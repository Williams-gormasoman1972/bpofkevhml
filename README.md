Man, I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Alto Knights and, dude, what a ride. I’m still kind of buzzing from it. You ever get that feeling like a dog chasing its tail? Yeah, that's me right now. Anyways, the plot’s wild, but in a good way, not in a ‘what the heck are they doing’ kind of way. The characters... man, some of them you just love to hate, and others you just wanna give a big ol' hug. Like, it's been a while since a   got me all twisted up like this. 

>Anyway, you ever sit there and think about who writes these crazy stories? Like, seriously, someone out there just dreamed this up. Mind-boggling, I tell ya. But hey, if nothing else, it’s worth a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. If you get the chance, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – just a heads up, it’s worth the space.

Oh, and speaking of 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨, there’s a part where this guy's just running through the streets like he's got a bee in his pants, and it was like all ninja style. My heart was in my throat, but also, I kinda wanted to laugh because it was just so extra, you know what I mean? But honestly, some of the scenes, they're just... ugh, chef’s kiss. But not in a pretentious way, more like, these guys love what they do.

Did I mention the soundtrack? It's like they hired some wizard composers or something. It just fits. You know, I was tapping my foot the whole time, couldn't help myself. Sometimes I'd get distracted by how good it was, instead of what was happening on screen. Ha! 

import this

But I guess in the end, it comes down to moments like those that make me think, yeah, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this   was time well spent. We gotta catch up properly soon, maybe even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it together. What do ya say?
